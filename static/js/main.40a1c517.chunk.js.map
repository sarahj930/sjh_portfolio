I signed on to this project to practice my skills of translating a well-intended product limited by bad design into a highly enjoyable and useful product. I began by looking at the application in its current state and using it, taking note of things that seemed off to me and ways I felt it could be improved. Then I worked with my boss to define the goals of the redesign to provide direction. I surveyed end users about what they thought about the application in its current state and what they wanted out of it. Through the summer, I created many different iterations of the redesign, testing with users and reworking the best of them. In the end, I had something that I was proud of and presented it to my bosses. Aesthetically, it was cleaner, brighter, and more in line with GE’s design guidelines. Experientially, it had much less superfluous information and was streamlined to the uses the users wanted and the company needed. I was able to take an application that was not useful or usable and create a proposal for an application that would hopefully become an integral part of a GE Power employee’s life.\"\n                />\n                <WorkItem1\n                  image=\"uberferplns.png\"\n                  title=\"Uber for Planes\"\n                  description1=\"This was a class project that I decided to make not only functional, but beautiful.
