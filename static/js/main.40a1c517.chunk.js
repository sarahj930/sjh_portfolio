Most of our participants seemed to want more time to talk to their one-on-one partners and groups, so one of the revisions we plan to make is to increase the time from 10 minutes to approximately 15 minutes for each session. While it wasn\u2019t part of our original design, we found sessions that had an informal chat at the beginning were primed for their one-on-one discussions, and was helpful in terms of getting participants to open up and connect \u2013 we plan to make this a formalized part of future designs. Many participants mentioned that they would like to have a way to contact the people they had conversations with, so we plan to revise our prototype to include a form (to join a slack group for example) for users to exchange their contact information before the session ends.We recieved feedback about it being uncomfortable to introduce your partner when moving from the one-on-one chats to the group meetings, but some people really enjoyed that aspect, so we plan to revise our prototype to make that optional so that participants feel as comfortable as possible. We also plan to emphasize on the flexibility of the discussion points we provide.",description4:" A lot of the users felt that it made them more comfortable and was a nice back up in case there was a lull in conversation, so we plan to have the structure available without making it mandatory. We also decided to add an optional hang out at the end of the sessions to talk more with other participants. We want to do this since we saw that some people preferred having more time, and we think this could provide a realistic lobby experience that people tend to have after attending in person shows.rd time imagining such situations and often answered questions about how they would feel in a situation with \u201cit depends\u201d.

Having a safe space to connect is vital to the theater community, so we have developed a way to fill this void through the creation of a system that fosters deep connection virtually.",description3:"Our in-depth research through interviews, contextual inquiry, and experiential prototyping has yielded key insights that aided in our solution. Through contextual inquiries, we have found that successful virtual communities often have a few core elements foundational to building connection: many have an emphasis on positivity, a degree of selectivity, many promote active interaction between members, and capitalize on the affordances provided by the virtual space. These types of communities are immensely valuable to people, bringing them positivity and hope in uncertain times.",description4:"In our speed dating and user testing sessions, we developed a better understanding of what is desirable and required to foster comfortable and genuine connection virtually. Users wanted to have a loose structure, such as guided discussion and moderation, that provides a sense of safety and familiarity, have a small group setting for intimacy, but also have some kind of social safety net in case of awkwardness when interacting with new people, have opportunities to engage with other members one-on-one for deeper connection",description5:"We have addressed these issues by creating a social matching experience based on a buddy system, which leverages existing virtual platforms like Zoom to pair individuals with similar interests. We give structure to these conversations with lightly guided, small-group discussions with optional conversation prompts based around mutual interests \u2013 this format both eases social anxiety and enables participants to build deep and long-term connections with other KST community members.
